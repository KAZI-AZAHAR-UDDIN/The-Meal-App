# The-Meal-App

This project is a web application that leverages the capabilities of vanilla JavaScript to deliver a seamless user experience. The primary feature of the app is its ability to search for food recipes using the Themealdb API. The API provides various data related to the searched recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information. The app then presents this information in an easily readable format, allowing users to quickly find the desired recipe.

In addition to the search feature, the app also includes the capability for users to view details of the selected recipe. This encompasses a more in-depth look at the recipe's ingredients and instructions, along with nutritional information. Users can also mark their favorite recipes for easy access in the future.

Overall, this project showcases your proficiency in working with APIs, JavaScript, and web development in general. The use of vanilla JavaScript ensures a lightweight and fast-performing application, without the need for any additional JavaScript frameworks. It's a valuable addition to your portfolio, demonstrating your ability to create a functional web application from scratch.
